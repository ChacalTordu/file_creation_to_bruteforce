# PROJECT BRUTEFORCE
While doing research on the internet for my Master 2 project, I often came across techniques called "Brute Force". It's a technique to break into a network by testing cracker strings as passwords.

A friend challenged me to guess his password from his phone. The only thing I know is that his password is length 6 and only lower case.

## First step
Our first step is to create a .txt file in which there will be all the possibilities. Don't forget to set your files executables with 'chmod +x'

## Second step
The second is to implement this .txt in a brute force tool, which we will see later.
